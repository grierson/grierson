Some basic techniques on how to learn more effectively

## What

- 80/20 rule (Prioritize what you learn)
  - Gaps in knowledge
  - Things you **need** to know
- Priming (Get a gist of what you are learning first)
- Questions
  - Why is it useful?
  - How can I use this?
  - How does compare with other solutions?

## Study

- Pomodoro [ LHTL ]
  - Set goal specific goal
  - Focused (No distractions)
  - Time box (25 minutes)

* Interleaving (Learn from multiple sources)

- Active recall (Explain what you just read)
- Take a break / Diffused mode / Hammock time [ LHTL ]
- Procrastination
  - Identify hurdles and remove them
  - Change of environment
  - Just do 2 mins so that you commit longer (Just walk to the gym)
