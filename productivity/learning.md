# (WIP) How to learn

Some basic techniques on how to learn more effectively

## Mindset

> “Whether you think you can, or you think you can't--you're right.”
> ― Henry Ford

- Avoid negative thoughts

  - If you think you can't do it how are you ever going to learn

- Feed good

  - Be curious about topic
  - Enjoy learning (Change environment, remove distractions)
  - Enjoy the process (Lot's of work is bad/wrong but you learn from it)

  - Freedom [^FLOW]
  - Curious [^MWE]
  - Stay true to yourself [^TAOL]
  - Mindset + Motivation [^LJK]
  - Believe + Enjoy + Self Talk [^TCM]
  - Enjoy the process [^TPSG]
  - See [^GBAA]

## Goal

- Prioritize what you learn
  - 80/20 rule - Small subset will get you 80% of the way
  - Gaps in knowledge
  - What your likely to encounter
  - What do I need to memorize
- Set a vision of what you want to be
- Priming (Get a gist of what you want to learning first)
- Questions you should ask
  - Why is it useful?
  - How can I use this?
  - How does compare with other solutions?
  - What one thing can I do such that by doing it, makes everything else easier or unnecessary?
- Ask experts
  - What the most important skills to learn?
  - What is the biggest waste of time?

## Learning resources

- Use books, blogs, videos, podcasts

  - Anything that helps you understand the topic
  - View the topic from a different perspective

- Learn two related topics at the same times to identify similarities

  - Spanish and German
  - Guitar and Drums

  - Brute force learning [^TOSTM]
  - Multi-Learning [^TOSTM]
  - Drill [^USY]
  - Pomodoro [^LHTL]

## Deliberate Practice

- Set goal specific goal (Sweet spot - not too easy, not too hard)
- Feedback (Quickly check if you're right)
- Focused (No distractions, nice environment)
- Time box (25 minutes - Pomodoro)

  - Pomodoro [^LHTL]
    - Short focused intense sessions of learning
  - Distraction free [^DEEPWORK]
  - Invest in Loss [^TAOL]
    - You learn more from your mistakes (Feedback)
  - Pain + Reflection = Progress [^PRD]

## Challenge understanding

- Feynman technique

  - Finds gaps in knowledge
  - "If you can't explain it simply, you don't understand it well enough" - Albert Einstein
  - Apply to real world scenario
  - Compare with other solutions
  - Diagrams

![Feynman](../resources/feynman-technique.jpg)

- Mock tests
- Flash cards
- Recall (How much can you remember what you just learned)
- Build something with what you just learned

* References
  - [^LHTL] Test yourself
  - [^TOSTM] Push yourself up the learning pyramid

## Stuck [^LHTL]

- Diffused mode / Hammock time
  - Diffused mode = Shower thoughts
  - Focused mode = Active thinking

  - Diffused thinking [^LHTL]

## Remember what you learn

- Spaced repetition (6hr, 24hr, 3d, 7d, 14d) [ LHTL ]
- Flashcards
