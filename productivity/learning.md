# (WIP) How to learn

All about `focus`, `getting into the zone` or a `flow state` where you know
what you are doing and has your full attention.

## Motive

Get invested to motivate and enjoy the journey.

- Be Invested / Passion / Have a purpose / Vision

  - Set a vision of what you want to be?
  - What word encompasses that vision?
  - Do more of what matters to me
  - Know Why you are learning <X>

- Enjoy the process

  - What would this look like if it were fun?
    - Change environment
    - Turn task it into a challenge
  - Lot's of your work will bad but you learn from mistakes so have fun
  - Make tasks small so you get easy wins

  - Enjoy the process [^TPSG]

## Target

- Prioritize what you learn
  - 80/20 rule - 80% of outcome come fro 20% of causes
  - Prioritize gaps/weaknesses in knowledge
  - What one thing can I do such that by doing it, makes everything else easier or unnecessary? [^TOQTAY]
  - What do I need to memorize?
  - What you're likely to encounter?
    - I want to build <X>: Promotes exploration and asking further questions
    - Learning Spanish: Asking for taxi, not grammatical nuances
  - Ask experts in that field
    - What the most important skills to learn?
    - What is the biggest waste of time?
    - Quiz them on their thought process? (Why did you do this?)
    - Make sure they explain their thought process in baby steps
- Questions you should ask
  - What's the problem?
  - Why is this solution useful?
  - How can I use this to solve my problem?
  - How does this compare with other solutions?

## Pre-Practice

- Priming

  - Get a gist of what your learning

- Prior Art: Use books, blogs, videos, podcasts

  - Anything that helps you understand the topic
  - View the topic from a different perspective

- Learn two related topics at the same times to identify similarities

  - Spanish and German
  - Guitar and Drums

  - Brute force learning [^TOSTM]

## Practice (Work smart, not harder)

- Small challenges towards goal with feedback (Quickly check if you're right or wrong)
  - Sweet spot (Not too easy, not to hard)
  - Build stuff
  - Mock tests
  - Flash cards
  - Recall as much can you remember of what you just learned
  - Write down your confidence level then compare after the session
  - Examples
    - Drawing: Draw face from memory then compare with reference
    - Reading: Recall what you've just read from memory
    - Chess: Guess next move
    - Spanish: Hear start of Spanish phrase, then try and finish it
    - 100m run: How can I take off faster?
- Focused (No distractions, nice environment)
- Time box (25 minutes - Pomodoro)

- Feynman technique

  - "If you can't explain it simply, you don't understand it well enough" - Albert Einstein
  - Finds gaps in your knowledge
  - Apply to real world scenario

## Stuck (Take a break)

- Diffused mode / Hammock time
  - Diffused mode = Shower thoughts
  - Focused mode = Active thinking

## Remember (Use it or lose it)

- Spaced repetition (6hr, 24hr, 3d, 7d, 14d) [ LHTL ]
