# Work iteratively with Feedback (Don't be Don Quixote instead fail fast)

Don't try and plan everything upfront unless you can accuratly predict

* Users needs
* Time/Cost and if it's profitable
* Accurate plan that doesn't need adjusting

Instead work in small units of work then get feedback to determine if you're
heading in the right direction

"Do users like the feature?" It's better to learn user don't like the feature
after 1 month rather than 1 year of development

## Feedback (HEO)

Try and get feedback as quickly as possible (Fail fast)

* Hypothesis - I think hypothesis will help
* Experiment - Test to Prove or Disprove hypothesis
* Observe - That the results to see if it matches your hypthesis

* **Experiment Driven Development** - Feedback from user metrics
* **Contious integration** - Feedback feature integrates into project
* **Contious deployment** - Feedback deployed feature works
* **Test driven development** - Feedback the feature works as expected
* **REPL** - Feedback that code works as expcted
* **Observability** - Feedback on how our system is working
* **Microservices** - Feedback new features are beneficial

## Design

Break the problem down so we can focus on a specific problem without having
to worry about other dependencies. Makes change easier

* **Modularity** - If axe handle breaks then just replace the handle
* **Seperation of Concern** - Make change without impacting other areas
* Decoupling
* High coheision
* Encapsultation

* **Debugging** - Nan focus bug w/o unessary dependencies
* **Microservices** - Create new services with no legacy design/code

* **Iterative** - Refining and improving over a series of iterations
* **Incremental** - Decouple problems so you can focus on specific problem
