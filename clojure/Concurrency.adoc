= Concurrency 

== Race conditions
As two threads can read and write to the same location the value depends on the order of the reads and writes.

=== OOP Concurrency
Objects have no concurrency coordination leading to nondeterministic results. Multiple threads reading and writing the the same location (Object, PLOP).

WARNING: One increment could be lost. If both Threads run simultaneously, both will read Count of 0 and update to 1 so one increment will be missed.

class Counter:
    def __init__(self):
        self.count = 0

    def Increment():
        self.counter += 1

myCount = new Counter()

a = threading.Thread(myCount.Increment());
b = threading.Thread(myCount.Increment());

a.start();
b.start();
a.join();
b.join();

print(myCount.Count) # 1 or 2 ??

=== Mutual Exclusion (Mutex)
Make your program single threaded.

=== Deadlocks 
Make your program single threaded.

== Clojure Concurrency
Clojure adds concurrency models to handle updating state.

* atom
** reference type like the epochal time model below 
* refs
** transactions - all or nothing
* core.async
