## Decouple Pure and Impure code

[TODO]: Why decoupling Pure and Impure code is important

### What is Pure code

`Pure` = Deterministic + No side effects

Given the same input you will always receive the same output,
regardless of how many times it's called or when it's called.

It also means it doesn't perform any `Side effects` ([more](#what-is-impure-code)).

```mermaid
---
title: Same input, Same Output
---
flowchart LR
  style Add fill:ForestGreen
  Addend1 --> Add
  Addend2 --> Add
  Add --> Sum
```

```mermaid
---
title: Add item to cart
---
flowchart LR
  style AddItem fill:ForestGreen
  Cart["Cart (Empty)"] --> AddItem
  Item --> AddItem --> CartResult["Cart (with item added)"]

```

```mermaid
---
title: Item not added to cart because cart is full
---
flowchart LR
  style AddItem fill:ForestGreen
  Cart["Cart (Full)"] --> AddItem
  Item --> AddItem --> CartResult["Cart (item not added because full)"]
```

### What is Impure code

`Impure` = Non-deterministic because of external dependencies
and/or performs `Side effect`

```mermaid
---
title: Non-deterministic because of System clock - Same call different results
---
flowchart LR
  style Now fill:FireBrick
  Now["now()"] --> 27/01/2017
  style Now2 fill:FireBrick
  Now2["now()"] --> 20/01/2021
```

`Side effect` = Interacts with the external system and/or changes state

```mermaid
---
title: Side effect - Changes state of database
---
flowchart TD
  style Impure fill:FireBrick
  Enviroment -- Reads from --> Impure
  Impure["Update()"] -- Calls --> Database["database.update(entity)"]
```

We still need to interact with the real `impure` world to get stuff done.

* Working with Databases and Gateways
* Sending emails
* Getting the current time

A method that changes an objects state is another example of an `impure` operation

* Calling `user.GetName()` returns `Alice`
* `user.UpdateName(Bob)` changes the state of the `user` object
* Calling `user.GetName()` again now returns a different result `Bob`
* Making `user.GetName()` non-deterministic
* `user.UpdateName()` is `impure` as it changed the state of `user`

### Why the `Pure` and `Impure` language

`Impure` code calling `Pure` code remains `Pure`.
`Pure` code calling `Impure` code becomes `Impure`,
as the call is non-deterministic, making it non-deterministic.

```mermaid
---
title: Impure infection Before
---
flowchart LR
  style Run fill:FireBrick
  style Pure1 fill:ForestGreen
  style Pure2 fill:ForestGreen
  style Pure3 fill:ForestGreen
  Run --> Pure1 --> Pure3
  Run --> Pure2
```

```mermaid
---
title: Impure infection - After
---
flowchart LR
  style Run fill:FireBrick
  style Impure1 fill:FireBrick
  style Pure2 fill:ForestGreen
  style Impure3 fill:FireBrick
  Run --> Impure1 --> Impure3["now()"]
  Run --> Pure2
```

### Prefer pure

With all that in mind, prefer `Pure` code over `Impure` code.
As it's easier to reason and test because it's deterministic.

I've created a simple code example that mixes the two.
It's game were you have to guess if the next card is higher or lower.
(Like Play Your Cards Right)

I've highlighted which parts are `Pure` and `Impure`

* Red - `Impure` code
* Green - `Pure` code

```diff
// Function to generate a random card value between 1 and 13
- function generateCard() {
-  return Math.floor(Math.random() * 13) + 1;
-}

// Function to start the game
function playGame() {
-  const currentCard = generateCard();
-  console.log(`Current card: ${currentCard}`);

  // User's guess
-  const userGuess = prompt("Will the next card be higher or lower or same? (h/l/s)");

-  const nextCard = generateCard();
-  console.log(`Next card: ${nextCard}`);

+  if ((userGuess === 'h' && nextCard > currentCard) || 
+      (userGuess === 'l' && nextCard < currentCard) ||
+      (userGuess === 's' && next == currentCard) {
-    console.log("You guessed it right!");
+  } else {
-    console.log("Sorry, you guessed it wrong.");
  }
}

// Call the playGame function to start the game
playGame();
```

So the above `playGame` holds a lot of complexity.

* Handling user input
  * `3` (`h|l|s`) permutations
* Generating random cards
  * `13` (`1,2,..,13`) permutations
* Comparing the cards
  * `169` (`13x13`) distinct pairs
* Comparing the user input with the comparison
  * `507` (`169 * 3`) guesses and comparisons

`507` possible outcomes (that's even ignoring errors).
Ideally we should test the edge cases to make sure it works.

| Guess | Current Card | Next Card | Correct? |
| ------------- | -------------- | -------------- | ----- |
| Higher | 1 | 2 | Yes |
| Lower | 1 | 2 | No |
| Same | 1 | 2 | No |
| ... | ... | ... | ... |

However, adding tests for this code is difficult

* `Console` is required for input and output
* Code generates random cards making it non-deterministic

Instead by splitting out the `Pure` logic from
the `Impure` code it makes it easier to test.

```diff
function compare(userGuess, currentCard, nextCard) {
+  if (userGuess === 'h' && nextCard > currentCard ||
+      userGuess === 'l' && nextCard < currentCard ||
+      userGuess === 's' && nextCart == currentCard)
+   return "Correct";
+  return "Sorry, you guessed wrong"
}

function playGame() {
-  const currentCard = generateCard();
-  console.log(`Current card: ${currentCard}`);

  // User's guess
-  const userGuess = prompt("Will the next card be higher or lower? (h/l)");
-  const nextCard = generateCard();
-  console.log(`Next card: ${nextCard}`);

+  const result = compare(userGuess, currentCard, nextCard);

-  console.log(result);
  }
}

// Tests
+ [2, 1, "h"]
+ [1, 2, "l"]
+ [1, 2, "s"]
+ .. many more test cases here ...
+ test("Invalid guesses", (guess, current, next) => {
+  const actual = compare(guess, current, next)
+  expect(actual).is("Sorry, you guessed wrong")
+})
```

* Easier to read
  * Can read `compare (Pure)` logic without any `Impure` context
* Easier to automated test
  * No Console required (Avoids manual testing)
  * No stubbing of random card generator
  * Just input and expected output. (Parameterized tests)
* Reuse `compare` in different contexts
  * Currently uses `Console`
  * Could be used in a `RESTFUL` API instead
* No unexpected results
  * Deterministic
  * Same input, Same output

## (WIP) Decouple Domain from the Outside world

You want to change internal processes without external dependencies.

* External dependency change impacts Domain model
* Change `Domain` model without changing contract with consumers

* Database `Entity` for `ORM`
* `HttpRequest` for `HTTP`
* `Data Model` from `Third party` API or Library
  * `Stripe` has a `Session object`
  * `Fast Healthcare Interoperability Resources (FHIR)`

Glossary

1. Application (App) - Business logic. No reference to any technologies
1. Port - Required interface. Port captures the Idea of a conversation
1. Driving and Driven actors -
1. Adapters - Needed at each port
1. Configurator - Composes all together

* Testing - Run Workflow tests without production (Purer and Faster)
* Prevents leakage - Prevents UI or technology details into business logic
* Swappable - Swap one `Adapter` with another `Adapter` to support a different technology
* Domain Driven Design - Focus on Domain design without technology details distractions

  AdapterIn["Adapter"] --> PortIn
  PortOut --> AdapterOut["Adapter"] 
  end
  i/oIn[I/O] --> AdapterIn
  AdapterOut --> i/oOut["I/O"]
```

### Port and Adapters (Persistence ignorance, Anti-Corruption layer)

`Adapter`

* Adapts `External Details` -> `Domain`
* Adapts `Domain` -> `External Details`

```mermaid
flowchart LR
  style Mixed fill:SaddleBrown
  style i/oIn fill:FireBrick
  style i/oOut fill:FireBrick
  subgraph Application
    Mixed
  end
  i/oIn[I/O] --> Mixed --> i/oOut[I/O] 
```

Here's another example to demonstrate `Adapters`.
Using the same game as before but this time for `HTTP` and saving
to `PostGres`.

I've highlighted which parts are `Domain` and `Details`

* Red - `Details`
* Green - `Domain`

```diff
function compare(HttpRequest request, nextCard) {
-  const currentCard = request.body.currentCard;
-  const userGuess = request.body.userGuess;

+  if (userGuess === 'h' && nextCard > currentCard ||
+      userGuess === 'l' && nextCard < currentCard ||
+      userGuess === 's' && nextCart == currentCard)
+   return "Correct";
+  return "Sorry, you guessed wrong"
}

function PlayGameHttp(HttpRequest request) {
-  const postGres = new PostGres("connection-string")
   const nextCard = generateCard();

+  const result = compare(request, nextCard);

-  postGres.save(result);
-  return HttpResponse(result);
}
```

This has problems with `Coupling` specific details about
`HTTP`, `PostGres` with our `Domain` logic

* What if we stop using `Http` or `PostGres`.
* What if we want to use `GRPC` and `Mongo`
* We don't want `HTTP` details contaminating our `Domain Logic`.
* We don't want `Domain Logic` knowing how to write to a `Database`

> [!NOTE]
> `External technical details` should be decoupled from our `Domain`

This is where `Ports and Adapters` comes in.
We create `Adapters` that handle `specific implementation details` and
converts them to `Domain` concepts and vice versa.

```diff
function postGresDatabase() {
-  const postGres = new PostGres("connection-string")

-  return {
-    save: (fn [data] postGres.save(data))
-  }
}

function compare(userGuess, currentCard, nextCard) {
+  if (userGuess === 'h' && nextCard > currentCard ||
+      userGuess === 'l' && nextCard < currentCard ||
+      userGuess === 's' && nextCart == currentCard)
+   return "Correct";
+  return "Sorry, you guessed wrong"
}

function play(Database database, HttpRequest request) {
  const nextCard = generateCard();
- const currentCard = getCard(request.body);
- const userGuess = getGuess(request.body);

+  const result = playgame(userGuess, currentCard, nextCard);

-  database.save(game, report);
}

function main(){
  var database = postGresDatabase();
  
  route("/play", (request) => {
    play(database, request);
  })
}
```

Now `compare` doesn't know anything about `HttpRequest` it just takes
data, so it can be used in different contexts like a `RPC` application instead.
It also makes it easier to test as we don't have to create a `HttpRequest`
for our tests.

We also pass in a `Database` implementation so we can use different implementations.
Especially useful for when testing as you can pass in a `Mock` instead when testing
the `play` function.
