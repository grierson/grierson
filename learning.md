# How to learn

## Work iteratively with Feedback (Don't be Don Quixote)

Don't try and plan everything upfront unless you can accuratly predict

* Users needs
* Time/Cost and if it's profitable
* Accurate plan that doesn't need adjusting

Instead work in small units of work then get feedback to determine if you're
heading in the right direction

"Do users like the feature?" It's better to learn user don't like the feature
after 1 month rather than 1 year of development

* Contionus integration - Feedback feature can be integrated into project
* Test Driven development - Feedback the feature works as expected

## Study

* What
  * 80/20 rule (Prioritise, Gaps in knowledge, Need to know)
* Learning
  * Flow state (Focused, Pomodoro)
  * Timebox
  * Set measurable goal
* Notes, questions, thoughts about content
  * How can I use this?
  * How does it relate to what I already know?
  * When will I use this?
  * Why must I use this?
* Understand
  * Feynman technique (Teach + Highlights gaps)
  * Diagrams
  * Apply in real world situation
  * Pros/Cons with other solutions
* Remember what you learn
  * Spaced repetition (6hr, 24hr, 3d, 7d, 14d)
  * Flashcards
