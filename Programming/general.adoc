Big overlap between Debugging and Testing

== General gist
something defect or new feature. Set expectation, try sample input, view how function works, add new code to fix/add feature.

. Plan (Thinking, Scientific method, Work backwards, Why is it failing)
. Experiment (Assertion, Property test, Example Based Test)
. Observe (Assert output, test output, traces, SpyScope, ScopeCapture)
. Fix/Implement
. Refactor
. Tests acts documentation

(Generative testing is good because it generates lots of examples and shrinks problem for you)

== Test
. Set expectations
. Test
. Clean up

== Debug
`Failure -> Hypothesis -> Prediction -> Experiment -> Observation -> Diagnosis`

== Overlap
* Failure (Some business/edge use case)
* Expectations (Hypothesis, Prediction)
* Test (Experiment, Observation)
* Diagnosis (Refactor)
