= Guide to Debugging

== Concepts 

=== Mine
. Failure -> What are you doing? What is the defect? Why is it a defect?
. Hypothesis -> Where is it happening? Why is it happening? 
. Prediction -> Given this state then this should happen
. Experiment -> Pass good or bad state into defect (Spy capture)
. Observation -> 
    * Check that your prediction was correct (Spy scope)
    ** If it was refine to narrow down to defect
    ** Come up with a new hypothesis
    ** Diagnose the problem
. Diagnosis -> Fix the problem

=== Cambium
. Observe the situation (problem)
. Form a hypothesis to explain the problem
. Devise and execute a test to show the correctness of your hypothesis
* Inconclusive? Try again.
* Conclusive? Good! The problem space has been reduced, try again with a smaller subset.

== Concrete 

. Scientific method (Methodology) 
* Why is it a failure? 
* Where it could of occurred?
* What might of caused the failure? 
** Function handles input incorrectly
** Out of bounds
** Time bomb (use case not handled)

. Setup test/experiment (Debugging Tools)
* I think this function is failing
* I think the cause is because of this input value 
* Add `(assert, spyscope)` to observe state
* Add `scope capture` to bind all local var to REPL debug
** So that you can REPL debug each section of the code in that state
* Create `property test` to generate inputs and shrink bad input 

. Run test/experiment (Methodology)
* Test potential cause of failure (Calling function with suspect bad state) 
* Did observations match prediction
** If it did narrow down your hypothesis to find defect
** If if it didn't replicate, new hypothesis 
** Or fix defect
