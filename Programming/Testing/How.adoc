= How Testing

* Red Green Refactor
* Order of tests

** Degenerate cases
*** nil, empty, 0, default, etc..

** Simple cases
*** One element (Sort kata)
*** A row (Diamond kata)
*** All 0 (Bowling kata)
*** (wrap 1 "a") (word wrap)

** Specific cases
*** Strike (Bowling kata)
*** Handle new line (wrap 1 "aa") (word wrap)
*** Word is mid line break (wrap 3 "a bb" (word wrap)

* Write assertion first
** So that the rest of the test writes itself

* Fake it til you make (Triangulation)
** "As the tests get more specific the code gets more generic"

* Run fast or you won't run them
* Readable
** Use `Is` instead of `Should be`
** Don't just follow Gherkin
*** [Bad] Given Delivery has a past date When try to deliver Then delivery should be invalid
*** [Good] Delivery with past date is invalid
* Isolated
** Tests need to be isolated from each other so tests can be run in parallel. If you share mutable state across tests it will lead to race conditions
