= Why Testing

* So you can refactor and clean up your mess 
* Prevent regressions so you don't break anything else 
* It's a good idea to understand what you are doing before you start 
** Writing your expectations first does that 
* Easily test edge cases 
** What if the user inputs 
*** nothing?
*** SQL?
*** a million characters?
* Tests act as documentation
