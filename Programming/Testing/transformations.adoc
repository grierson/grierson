| Transformation                 | Description                                          |
| ---                            | ---                                                  |
| {} → nil                       | no code at all → code that employs nil               |
| nil → constant                 | nil -> [] or 0 or ""                                 |
| constant → constant+           | a simple constant to a more complex constant         |
| constant → scalar              | replacing a constant with a variable or an argument  |
| statement → statements         | adding more unconditional statements.                |
| unconditional → if             | splitting the execution path                         |
| scalar → array                 |                                                      |
| array → container              |                                                      |
| statement → tail-recursion     |                                                      |
| if → while                     |                                                      |
| statement → non-tail-recursion |                                                      |
| expression → function          | replacing an expression with a function or algorithm |
| variable → assignment          | replacing the value of a variable.                   |
| case                           | adding a case (or else) to an existing switch or if  |
