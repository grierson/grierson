= Problem solving

Problems solving requires Understanding, Recognizing, and Stating the problem.
As a Developer you are not delivering features you are solving problems. Features are results, not objectives. 
The sum of features doesn't guarantee it will solve the problem.

== STATE THE PROBLEM!
1. Write a Problem Statement 
1. Current -> Gap -> Desired
.. Fear Setting (If we don't do <x> then <y> will happen) 
1. Deductive reasoning (Suduku)
** What do we know? (Constraints, Facts)
** What do we need to know? (What do we need to find out) 
1. 5 W's (Who, Where, When, What, and Why)
1. User story
** As a <role> I can <capability>, so that <receive benefit>
** In order to <receive benefit> as a <role>, I can <goal/desire>
** As <who> <when> <where>, I <want> because <why>

== Understand the problem
* Rubber duck programming
* Specification By Example
* Sleep on it

== Point at stuff
* Event storming
* UML (Box and arrows)
* Charts
** Bar chart
** Flow chart

== Break it down
* Root cause analysis
** Cause mapping

== Prioritize
* 80/20 principle 
* Minimum viable product (MVP)
* Work backwards 
** Start from goal to find shortest path there
** Force situations into known path

== Clarify the problem
* Update the problem statement
* Write more specific Specification By Examples
* Set a SMART goal
