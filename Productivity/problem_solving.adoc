= Problem solving

Problems solving requires Understanding, Recognizing, and Stating the problem.
As a Developer you are not delivering features you are solving problems. Features are results, not objectives. The sum of features doesn't guarantee it will solve the problem.

* https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/192221.How_to_Solve_It[How to solve it] (book)
* Dynamic programming

== STATE THE PROBLEM!
* Write a Problem Statement! 
* Current -> *Gap* -> Desired
* Fear Setting (If we don't do <x> then <y> will happen) 
* User story
** As a <role> I can <capability>, so that <receive benefit>
** In order to <receive benefit> as a <role>, I can <goal/desire>
** As <who> <when> <where>, I <want> because <why>
* Specification By Example

== Understand the problem
* Visualise
** Table
** Acyclic graph
** Flow chart
* Deductive reasoning (Suduku, Kakuro)
** What do we know? (Constraints, Facts)
* Break it down (Dynamic programming)
** Root cause analysis (Cause mapping)
* Visualise specific use cases
* Rubber duck programming
* Sleep/Shower/Smoke on it

== Break it down 
* Root cause analysis (Cause mapping)
* Update problem statement
** Create more smaller problem statements
* Dynamic programming

== Prioritize
* 80/20 principle 
* Minimum viable product (MVP)
* Work backwards 
** Start from goal to find shortest path to starting point
** Force situations into known path
