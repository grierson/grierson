= 21: Merge Two Sorted Lists

== Thinking
It's like the last step of merge sort

== Pseudo code
```
state = []
l1 = [1 2 4]
l2 = [1 3 4]

function state [x xs :as xcoll] [y ys :as ycoll]
  if x and y is null
    state
  if x is null
    state + ycoll
  if y is null
    state + xcoll
  
  if x <= y
    recur (cons state x) xs ycoll
  else
    recur (cons state y) xcoll ys

```

== Test cases

```
Handle empty
f [] [] => [] 
f [1] [] => [1] 
f [] [1] => [1] 

Handle order
f [1] [2] => [1 2] 
f [2] [1] => [1 2] 
f [1 2] [1] => [1 1 2] 
```
