# Why Event sourcing?

| Id  | Name    | Balance |
| --- | ------- | ------- |
| 1   | Alice   | $250    |
| 2   | Bob     | $80     |
| 3   | Charlie | $19,820 |

Above is a basic straw man CRUD update in place banking database.
However that's just a snapshot of the current state of accounts.
If we looked again in `2 weeks` the results (below) will be different as
transactions have occurred since.

| Id  | Name    | Balance |
| --- | ------- | ------- |
| 1   | Alice   | $40,850 |
| 2   | Bob     | $94     |
| 3   | Charlie | $20     |

Transactions are not recorded. Instead accounts are updated in place,
overwriting the original balance with a new balance after each transaction.

Which means we can't ask questions like

* Why is my balance now $0, What did I spend it on?
* How much did I spend over Christmas?
* How much was I paid this month?

**Event Sourcing** aims to resolve those limitations by
instead recording each **event** that occurs to an **event log**
and creating a **projection** based of those **events**.

## TL;DR Event Sourcing

Think Double-entry bookkeeping/Git/Redux and you're half way there.

Event sourcing is about recording each "event" that occurs then
playing over each to create a "projection"

## Pro (Debugging)

You wake up and discover you only have $10 left in your account.

> "Why the heck do I only have $10?!? I got paid last week!"

So you go and check your banking app's transactions.

| Date               | Description                | Amount  | Balance |
| ------------------ | -------------------------- | ------- | ------- |
| 31/10/2021 @ 12:00 | Paid                       | $2,500  | $3,000  |
| 1/11/2021 @ 06:00  | Bills                      | -$700   | $2,300  |
| 4/11/2021 @ 20:00  | Cinema                     | -$40    | $2,260  |
| 6/11/2021 @ 21:18  | 2 x Beers                  | -$20    | $2,240  |
| 6/11/2021 @ 22:51  | 2 x Beers + Crisp          | -$25    | $2,215  |
| 6/11/2021 @ 23:20  | Bob's money for last round | $25     | $2,240  |
| 6/11/2021 @ 23:32  | Whiskey                    | -$50    | $2,190  |
| 7/11/2021 @ 01:48  | Ebay (1989 Mazda MX5)      | -$2,180 | $10     |

Where you uncover you've drunkenly bought yourself an `1989 Mazda MX5`. "Uh oh..."

> [!NOTE]
> As your bank has recorded each transaction you can view whats happend and when

* Transaction = Event
* Transaction history = Event log
* Current Balance = Projection

## Pro (Temporal Query)

Your banking app shows your **current** balance by totaling
all of your deposit and withdrawal transactions.

However, using the exact same transaction log we can interpret the
data for different purposes, such as only totaling your **monthly** spend
or overall **annual** income so we can query over our data in
different ways whilst also taking time into account.

| Date               | Description                | Amount |
| ------------------ | -------------------------- | ------ |
| 31/10/2021 @ 12:00 | Paid                       | $2,500 |
| 6/11/2021 @ 23:20  | Bob's money for last round | $25    |

> Income: **$2,525**

| Date              | Description           | Amount  |
| ----------------- | --------------------- | ------- |
| 1/11/2021 @ 06:00 | Bills                 | -$700   |
| 4/11/2021 @ 20:00 | Cinema                | -$40    |
| 6/11/2021 @ 21:18 | 2 x Beers             | -$20    |
| 6/11/2021 @ 22:51 | 2 x Beers + Crisp     | -$25    |
| 6/11/2021 @ 23:32 | Whiskey               | -$50    |
| 7/11/2021 @ 01:48 | Ebay (1989 Mazda MX5) | -$2,180 |

> Outgoings: **$3,015**

## Pro (Replayability)

The Chess world uses `Chess notation` to record each move within a game
so games can be replayed later for review, where you can ask questions like
`"Where did I go wrong?", "What move should I have played at move 9?"` and
experiment playing different lines from different points in the game.
`What happens if I play Qb2 for move 6?`

* Chess Notation = Event
* Chess notation for game = Event Log
* Current board = Projection

## Pro/Con (More specific code)

Forces you to write specific concrete business logic for each usecase which is great for code matching business flow but also leads to specific code for everything
