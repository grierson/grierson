= Micro VS Monolith
Differences between the two

== Microservices

=== Pros
[cols="1,9"]
|===
| Thing | Why

| Develop 
a| 
* Each service is small and focused (No dependency conflicts from other features) 
* Can pick best tools for the service 
** If service is mainly write operations (RDBMS, Document, Graph)
** If service is mainly read operations (RDBMS, Document, Graph)
* Small so can be rewritten without impacting rest of the system 
| Build | 
| Test | 
| Deploy 
a| 
* Only have to deploy single service which includes the new feature
| Scale 
a| 
* Can increase/decrease the amount of instances of a specific service depending on load 
| Team 
a| 
* Developer only focused on a specific service 
** Less to learn in order to get up-to speed
|===

=== Cons
[cols="1,9"]
|===
| Thing | Why

| Orchestration 
a|
* Have to handle communications across many services

| Deployment 
a|
* Have to handle multiple instances of many services 
|===

== Monolith

=== Pros
[cols="1,9"]
|===
| Thing | Why

| Development 
a| Can easily coordinate multiple parts of the system as it's all in one place  
|===

=== Cons
[cols="1,9"]
|===
| Thing | Why

| Develop 
a| Growing team 

| More code = Harder to understand
a| Growing team 

| New technology
a| 
* Another part of the system might out of date lib stopping new features from using it

| Scale
a| 
* Have to deploy the entire system again if you want more instances
** Even though it's only the `Photo upload` feature that's under heavy load and needs more resources
