= Micro services

`The microservices architectural style is an approach to developing a single application as a suite of small services, each running in its own process and communicating with lightweight mechanism`

`Microsservices are small, autonomous services that work together`

Micro::
Does one thing "Bounded Context"

Service::
Does one thing "Bounded Context"

Lightweight mechanism::
Queues, HTTP

== Why
+ Scale
+ Increase development speed
. Micro/Bounded Context/Do one thing
.. Autonomously developed
.. Autonomously deployable
.. Solve systems that are too big
