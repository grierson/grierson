Book notes from Clean Agile by Uncle Bob

## Chapter 1 - Agile provides data

- > Agile is about knowing, as early as possible just how screwed we are.
- > Agile development is first and foremost a feedback-driven approach.
  > Each week, each day, each hour, and event each minute is driven by looking
  > at the results of the previous week, day, hour, and minute and then making the
  > appropriate adjustment. [...] Without data, the project cannot be managed.
- > One of the driving motivations for Agile software development is to provide
  > the data that managers need to decide how to set the coefficients on the
  > Iron Cross and drive the project to the best possible outcome.

Examples of data:

- Velocity Chart - Points completed per iteration/sprint
- Burndown Chart - Remaining points

### Project Managers are managing the Iron Cross

> The reality is that a good project manager understands that these four attributes
> have coefficients. A good manager drives a project to be good enough, fast enough,
> cheap enough, and done as much as necessary. A good manager manages the coefficients on these
> attributes rather than demanding that all these coefficients are 100%. It is this kind
> of management that Agile strives to enable.

Can only Pick 3

Changes Project manager can try to make

- Schedule
  - Business has usually set deadline for a reason (First to market, Contractual obligations, Match 3rd party release, etc.).
- Add staff
  - Not Cheap and slows team down (Brooks - Mythical Man Month)
- Decrease Quality
  - Slower
- **Changing Scope** (Usually best option)
  - Drop low priority features
