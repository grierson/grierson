# Continuous delivery

## What is - Continuous Integration (CI)

Frequently committing small releasable changes to master/main which are
verified on push

1. Small releasable commits
2. Push to master/main
3. CI Runs

* Pass Linting
* Pass Tests
* Build image

### Why - Continuous Integration

* Work in smaller steps (Less waste)
* Avoid big merge conflicts
* Early commits allows other devs to build upon changes

### What is - Continuous deployment

Automate deployment on every commit

### Why - Continuous deployment

* Manually deploying is error prone and time consuming
* Safer deployments
  * Blue/Green deployments
  * Canary deployments
* Deployment as code (No documentation/context)

## What is - Continuous delivery (CD)

`continuous integration + continuous deployment = continuous delivery`

### Why - Continuous delivery

* Quickly and easily deploying new features/fixes for faster feedback
* Less risky than a big deployment

### How

* Always releasable
  * Small commits to master that pass linting and tests
* Automate builds
  * Build script that run automatically (e.g. after each commit, new tag)
* Build as code
  * Build scripts in version control
* Use CD service
  * Runs on build server
* Ephemeral environments
  * Fresh build environment and image each run. (Avoid persisted state)

## DORA metrics

* Velocity
  * Deployment frequency (Multiple times a day)
  * Lead time (commit -> production) is less than an hour
* Stability
  * Time to restore service (< One hour)
    * Roll back on breaking release
    * Blue green deployments
    * Canary deployments
  * Change failure rate (< 15%)
