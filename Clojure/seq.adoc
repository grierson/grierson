= Seq

> "Sequences are the key abstraction that connects two of the most important parts of Clojure - immutable persistent collections and the sequence library." - Alex Miller

NOTE: `Seq` is that one data structure

Basically Lisp's core library only worked on lists because everything was just a list. 
However Clojure added extra data structures so the `Seq` abstraction was created so the core library could support them (and more). 

Data structures::
* list = '()
* vector = []
* set = #{}
* map = {}

So the `Seq` abstraction let you use most of the clojure.core library such as `(first rest reduce sort reverse ...)` on all the different data structures. For example.

[source, clojure]
----
(count '(1 2 3)) => 3
(count [1 2 3]) => 3
(count #{1 2 3}) => 3
(count #{1 2 3}) => 3
(count {:a 1 :b 2 :c 3}) => 3
----

== Implementation

[source, clojure]
----
(defprotocol ISeq
  "Persistent functional Sequence interface"
  (first [_] "get first item in collection")
  (rest [_] "get rest of collection")
  (cons [_ x] "add item to collection")) 
----

== Notes

* Vectors and Maps are not sequences but they are seqable, meaning that they can be converted to sequences.
* Collection that can be viewed as `seqs` are `seq-able`
