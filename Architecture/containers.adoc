= Containerisation

* Dockerfile -> Image -> Container
** Deps + files + build script -> Image (Like .iso image) -> Running Image

== Glossary
Dockerfile (Start script)::
List all specific dependencies and how to run project

Image (Constructor/Factory/Make)::
All dependencies bundled and used to create Containers

Container (Instance)::
A running image

Container Orchestrator (Manage many containers)::
* Scale amount of running containers depending on demand
* Handle deployment of new instances of containers
* Tools [Kubernetes, Swarm]

== Why
* Run many apps on one server
* VM's require Hypervisor + Guest OS, Containers don't, so it's smaller and faster
* Fixes "It works on my machine" problem as Dockerfile list all specific versions

== Docker CLI
* docker ps - List all containers
* docker build - Dockerfile -> Dockerimage
** -t <name> | Add name to image
* docker push - Push image to cloud provider to host or run
* docker run - Run docker image
** -p <Local port>:<Container port> | Port forwarding within docker container
* docker compose up/down - Run many containers
** docker-compose.yaml

== Dockerfile
* FROM
** Must be first instruction
** Is the base image
* WORKDIR
** Set working diretory for all following instructions
* COPY
** Copy files to docker image
* RUN
** Runs command
* .dockerignore
** Files for docker to ignore
* EXPOSE
* ?
* CMD
** Only one instruction in dockerfile
** How to run project
