= Micro VS Monolith

== Microservices

=== Pros
[cols="1,9"]
|===
| Thing | Why

| Development 
a| 
* Each service is small and focused (No dependency conflicts from other features) 
* Use the best tool for the job
** So if a service has heavy read operations use the best tools for reading or if the service is heavy on write operations then use the best tool for write operations. You don't have to use the same tool for everything  
* Small so can be rewritten without impacting rest of the system

| Build
a|

| Test
a| Smaller capability so easier to test

| Deploy 
a| 
Only deploying new/updated service with new features/updates

| Scale 
a| 
Can scale the amount of instances of a service depending on load

| Team 
a| 
* Developer only focused on a specific service
** Less to learn in order to get up-to speed
|===

=== Cons
[cols="1,9"]
|===
| Thing | Why

| Testing workflow across many services
a|
* Have to setup many services test entire workflow

| Orchestration 
a|
* Have to handle communication across many services
* Chatty communication can cause performance issues

| Deployment 
a|
* Have to handle multiple instances of many services
** Need a CI pipeline and container orchestra (Kubernetes)

| Monitoring
a|
* Need centralised tool to monitor and check logs of entire system

== Monolith

=== Pros
[cols="1,9"]
|===
| Thing | Why

| Development 
a| Can easily coordinate multiple parts of the system as it's all in one place  
| Deployment 
a| Only have to deploy one application
|===

=== Cons
[cols="1,9"]
|===
| Thing | Why

| Development 
a| Modules become entangled causing coupling

| More code 
a| 
* Harder to maintain 
** Complexity added over time
** Technical debt (Old dependencies, bad design)

| New technology
a| 
* Another part of the system might out of date lib stopping new features from using it

| Deployment
a|
* Risky
** Single line of code changes requires entire redeployment
** Causes downtime

| Scale
a| 
* Have to deploy the entire system again if you want more instances
** Even though it's only the `Photo upload` feature that's under heavy load and needs more resources
