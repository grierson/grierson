Node stores data and references to next node.

[source, python]
----
class Node:
  def __init__(self, value, nxt):
    self.Value = value
    self.Next = nxt

* Used in `stacks` and `queues` because
** Items constantly added/removed from head
** List size constantly changing

|===
| Pro | Con

| List can grow/shrink without reallocation | No random access
|=== 

|===
| | Linked List | Array | Note

| Access | O(n) | O(1) | Linked List has to step through each node. Array already in order
| Insert/Remove first | O(1) | O(n) | LL Add to head, Array has to reallocate 
| Insert/Remove last | O(n) | O(1) | LL step through each, Array can remove without realloc
| Insert/Remove middle | O(n) | O(n) | Linked List step through list, Array has to reallocate
